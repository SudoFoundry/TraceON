      summary: Checks if the user has been in direct contact with another user with a confirmed COVID-19 case.
      description: >
        The endpoint searches the user's contact to the devices compatible with this platform in the last 14 days (default). Then, all the users that interacted with the said device within a certain period of time (stride, default 2 hours) are checked if they have the COVID-19. The endpoint returns relevant data regarding the list of users (i.e. time of association with the device), and a array of user ids of direct confirmed cases.
