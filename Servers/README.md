# Servers

The lambda servers serving the endpoints required for things to work out properly. Some helper scripts are included to help deploy the lambdas. Please have the standard distribution of tools (found in Ubuntu) and the AWS CLI fully configured for them to work. The region used is `us-east-1`.
